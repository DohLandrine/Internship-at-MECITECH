# Day 1 - Introduction & First Hardware Task

**Date:**Â Monday July 23 2025

## Tasks Done

* Officially welcomed at MECITECH.
* Introduced to company members, rules, regulations, and assigned a supervisor.
* Received and began working on the first task involving hardware control.

## Task Description

Build a hardware control system using two toggle buttons and two LEDs:

* **button\_1** controls **led\_1**:

  * LED should **turn on for 640 milliseconds**, then **off for 420 milliseconds**.
* **button\_2** controls **led\_2**:

  * LED should **turn on for 860 milliseconds**, then **off for 480 milliseconds**.

Both LED controls should run **simultaneously**, independently of each other.

## What I Learned

* Practical use of buttons and LEDs in embedded systems.
* Basics of hardware timing using millis function.
* Importance of concurrent event handling in microcontroller projects.

## Tools/Technologies Used

* Microcontroller (Arduino)
* Toggle buttons
* LEDs
* C/C++ (Arduino-like logic)
