# Day 3 - Bluetooth Communication with ESP32

**Date:** Wednesday July 25, 2025

## Tasks Done

- Assigned a self-guided project involving Bluetooth communication using ESP32.
- Tasked with building a system where a mobile phone sends data to the ESP32 over Bluetooth.
- Implemented basic data reception on the ESP32 and displayed the result via serial output.

## Task Description

Build a Bluetooth communication system with the following objectives:

- Use a **mobile phone** to send data to the ESP32 using a Bluetooth app.
- Receive the data on the **ESP32** via Bluetooth.
- Display the received data on the **Serial Monitor** for verification.
- This project is designed to build foundational skills in **wireless communication with ESP32**.

The task was to be completed **independently** using resources such as YouTube tutorials or AI tools, then presented to the supervisor for evaluation.

## What I Learned

- Basics of Bluetooth Serial communication (ESP32 as a Bluetooth server).
- How to pair and transmit data from a mobile phone to a microcontroller.
- Using the Arduino IDE to monitor serial data reception in real-time.

## Tools/Technologies Used

- ESP32_DEVK1tc_V4
- Arduino IDE
- Serial Monitor
- Android Bluetooth Terminal App
- Online learning resources (YouTube, AI tools)
